Twitter
============

Create a twitter app on https://apps.twitter.com/ . After creating the app you will get the consumer key and access token details from the tab 'Keys and Access Tokens'.

Enter the Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token and Access Token Secret in our extensions control panel and save the settings. You can enter a custom message on the field 'Message Text Format' which will be shared along with the page. By using some formatted texts you can include some page properties in the message. You will get the format informations for each social media by clicking on the link 'Show format info'.(Only 140 characters are allowed to tweet on twitter, in which  23 characters are reserved for page links in our extension. If you are using custom images it will also consume another 23 characters.)

You can verify the settings by clicking on the button 'Submit Test Tweet'.
